## DESCRIPTION

This is a Node.js logo generator that I've written. It prompts the user to enter a three-letter company name, followed by a color, and then a shape, to create a simple logo.

## CREDITS

This program was written by me, Kyle Oros, with assistance from an AskBCS assistant. I referred to instructor chapters in the UCI bootcamp to assist in my writing.
